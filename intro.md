# Privacy and transparency

This is an introductory lesson on the difficult trade-offs between privacy and
transparency in data collected by a public agency.

The idea and initial material for the lesson comes from a lecture by David
Wagner from the Berkeley Data Science course; you'll see the exact source and thanks in the lesson notebook.

The lesson emphasizes several key things about the practice of data science.

* We are using real data that is raw as possible, and running the cleaning
  commands, so you can see exactly how we can go from the raw data to the data
  we can use.
* There are no, or at least, very few, instances of hand-wavy "here's one
  I prepared earlier" or "don't worry about the details here".  The details are data science.
* The fact that I could use and adapt this fine piece of exposition is thanks
  to a culture of sharing teaching materials that is a feature of the data
  science movement, in which Berkeley has been leading, although with [some
  imperfections](https://github.com/data-8/textbook/issues/36).  We really are
  standing on the shoulders of giants.
